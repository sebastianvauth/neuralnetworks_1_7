        <h1>Understanding Neural Network Architectures</h1>
        
        
        <p>In the previous lesson, we learned how to build a basic neural network with an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. Now, let's delve deeper into understanding different neural network <strong>architectures</strong> and how they are designed.</p>
        <div class="continue-button" onclick="showNextSection(2)">Continue</div>
    </section>

    <section id="section2">
        <h2>The Importance of Architecture</h2>
        <p>The architecture of a neural network refers to its overall structure, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Number of layers: How many layers are there between the input and output?</li>
            <li>Number of neurons per layer: How many neurons are in each layer?</li>
            <li>Connectivity pattern: How are the neurons connected between layers? Are all neurons in one layer connected to all neurons in the next layer (fully connected), or are there other connection patterns?</li>
            <li>Type of activation functions: What activation functions are used in each layer?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The choice of architecture has a significant impact on the network's ability to learn and solve different types of problems. Different architectures are suited for different tasks.</p>
        <div class="why-it-matters">
            <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
            <p>Choosing the right architecture is crucial for building a successful neural network. A well-designed architecture can make the difference between a model that learns effectively and one that struggles to converge or generalizes poorly.</p>

    <section id="section3">
        <p>Let's revisit the concept of <strong>fully connected layers</strong>, which we touched upon in the previous lesson. In a fully connected network, each neuron in one layer is connected to every neuron in the next layer.</p>
        <div class="interactive-placeholder">
            <img src="/placeholder.svg?height=300&width=600" alt="A diagram of a neural network with fully connected layers. Clearly labeled layers (input, hidden, output) with lines showing that each neuron in one layer is connected to every neuron in the next layer.">

    <section id="section4">
        <p>Now, let's explore what happens when we add more hidden layers. A network with multiple hidden layers is often referred to as a <strong>deep neural network</strong>. The "depth" of the network refers to the number of hidden layers.</p>
        <div class="interactive-placeholder">
            <img src="/placeholder.svg?height=300&width=600" alt="A diagram of a neural network with an input layer, three hidden layers, and an output layer. Different colors or shades distinguish the layers. Clearly labeled layers (Layer 0, Layer 1, Layer 2, Layer 3, Layer 4).">
            <p>A neural network with multiple hidden layers. The 'depth' of the network refers to the number of hidden layers.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Adding more layers allows the network to learn more complex and abstract representations of the data. Each layer can learn to extract different features, building upon the features learned by the previous layers.</p>
        <p>However, increasing the depth also comes with challenges. Deeper networks can be more difficult to train due to issues like the vanishing gradient problem. They also require more data and computational resources.</p>
        <div class="stop-and-think">
            <h3>Stop and Think</h3>
            <h4>Why do you think deeper networks can learn more complex patterns?</h4>
            <button class="reveal-button" onclick="revealAnswer('stop-and-think-1')">Reveal</button>
            <p id="stop-and-think-1" style="display: none;">Each layer in a deep network can learn to extract different levels of features from the data. For example, in image recognition, the first layer might learn to detect edges, the second layer might learn to detect shapes, and the third layer might learn to detect objects. By combining these features, deeper networks can learn more complex and abstract representations, enabling them to model intricate relationships in the data.</p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <div class="faq-section">
            <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
            <h4>What is the difference between a deep neural network and a shallow one?</h4>
            <p>A deep neural network has multiple hidden layers, while a shallow network typically has only one or a few hidden layers. Deep networks can learn more complex patterns but are generally more challenging to train.</p>
            <h4>How many hidden layers should a neural network have?</h4>
            <p>There's no fixed rule. The optimal number of hidden layers depends on the complexity of the problem, the amount of data available, and computational resources. It often requires experimentation and techniques like cross-validation to find the best architecture for a given task.</p>
            <h4>What are some other types of neural network architectures besides feedforward networks?</h4>
            <p>Besides feedforward networks, there are other important architectures like convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are particularly well-suited for image data, and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which are designed for sequential data like text or time series. We'll explore these in later lessons.</p>

        <p>In this lesson, we've explored the concept of neural network architectures, focusing on the number of layers, the number of neurons per layer, and the connectivity pattern. We've seen how adding more hidden layers can enable the network to learn more complex patterns but also introduces challenges in training. We also discussed that the "depth" of the network refers to the number of hidden layers. In the next lesson, we'll introduce some of the popular deep learning frameworks that are used to build and train these networks.</p>
